Win No. 2: I got a lot of help and advice from my classmates and instructors throughout the project; they made me feel very comfortable and supported in my work effort.
Challenge No. 1: Iteration 5 gave me a lot of trouble, as I kept second-guessing how I was supposed to complete it. I overcame this by asking my instructors for advice.
Challenge No. 2: It was difficult to intuit many details of working with the DOM in JavaScript. I overcame this difficulty by extensive use of the MDN online doucmentation.
